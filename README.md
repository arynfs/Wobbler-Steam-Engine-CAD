## Project Description

The Wobbler Steam Engine is a type of Stirling engine that utilizes steam as the working fluid. This design incorporates a wobbler mechanism, which converts the linear motion of the piston into rotational motion to drive a flywheel. The project showcases the use of CAD for designing mechanical systems and serves as a practical application of heat conversion, thermodynamics, and mechanical motion.

## CAD Design Files

The CAD files for the Wobbler Steam Engine are provided in this repository. These files are designed using **[CAD software name, e.g., SolidWorks, AutoCAD, etc.]**, and are available for download in **[file format, e.g., .stl, .dwg, .step]**.

Key files include:
- **Engine Base Assembly** (.stl)
- **Steam Chamber Design** (.stl)
- **Wobbler Mechanism** (.stl)
- **Flywheel and Piston Assembly** (.stl)

These files can be used to 3D print the components or as a reference for further design or modifications.

## Assembly Instructions

To replicate or modify the assembly, follow the steps outlined below:

1. **Download and Open CAD Files**: Start by opening the CAD files in your preferred software.
2. **Component Assembly**: Use the assembly files to piece together the individual components, such as the base, steam chamber, piston, flywheel, and wobbler mechanism.
3. **Check Interactions**: Ensure that all moving parts interact smoothly in the CAD environment. Adjust tolerances as needed.
4. **Simulate Motion**: Run motion simulations in your CAD software to verify the operation of the wobbler mechanism and piston movement.
5. **Finalize Design**: Once everything is functioning properly in the CAD environment, you can export files for 3D printing or manufacturing.

## How It Works

The Wobbler Steam Engine operates on the principle of steam expansion. When steam is introduced into the steam chamber, it drives the piston in a reciprocating motion. The wobbler mechanism then converts this linear motion into rotational motion, turning the flywheel. The continuous steam flow keeps the engine operating in a cyclical manner, demonstrating the conversion of thermal energy into mechanical work.

## Usage

1. **Prepare the CAD Files**: After downloading the files, load them into your 3D printer or machining software.
2. **Print/Manufacture Parts**: Fabricate the parts as per the design specifications in the CAD model.
3. **Assemble the Components**: Once the parts are manufactured, assemble them as shown in the CAD assembly files.
4. **Test the Engine**: After assembly, connect a steam source to the steam chamber and observe the movement of the flywheel and piston mechanism.

**Note**: The CAD files provided are for educational and design purposes, and may need to be adjusted based on your specific manufacturing process or materials used.
